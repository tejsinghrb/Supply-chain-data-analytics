Introduction
Supply Chain Data Analytics is a web-based application that helps supply chain professionals analyze supply chain data to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance overall supply chain performance. The application integrates with various data sources, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, warehouse management systems (WMS), and transportation management systems (TMS), to collect and analyze supply chain data in real-time.

Features
Data Integration: The application supports integration with ERP systems, WMS, TMS, and other data sources to import supply chain data directly into the application. It collects data such as inventory levels, order data, transportation data, and supplier performance metrics.

Data Visualization: The application provides interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize supply chain data. Users can explore key performance indicators (KPIs) such as order fulfillment rates, inventory turnover, on-time delivery, and transportation costs to gain insights into supply chain performance.

Demand Forecasting: Supply Chain Data Analytics utilizes historical data and statistical models to generate accurate demand forecasts. This helps supply chain professionals optimize inventory levels, production planning, and procurement to meet customer demand effectively.

Inventory Optimization: The application analyzes inventory data, demand patterns, and lead times to optimize inventory levels and reduce carrying costs. Supply chain professionals can identify slow-moving items, implement reorder points, and determine optimal safety stock levels to avoid stockouts while minimizing inventory holding costs.

Supplier Performance Analysis: Supply Chain Data Analytics enables the evaluation of supplier performance based on metrics such as delivery reliability, lead times, quality, and pricing. Users can identify underperforming suppliers, negotiate better terms, and make informed decisions regarding supplier relationships.

Transportation Optimization: The application provides tools for analyzing transportation data, route optimization, and carrier performance. Supply chain professionals can optimize transportation costs, minimize lead times, and identify opportunities for consolidation or mode shifting to improve overall transportation efficiency.

Setup
To set up Supply Chain Data Analytics, follow these steps:

System Requirements: Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements for running the application. This may include specific hardware, software, and operating system versions. Refer to the installation instructions or system requirements document for more details.

Installation: Download the Supply Chain Data Analytics application from the official website or the designated repository. Follow the installation guide to install the application on your server or local machine. Make sure to configure any required dependencies or environment variables during the installation process.

Data Integration: Configure the data integration module to connect Supply Chain Data Analytics with the necessary data sources, such as ERP systems, WMS, and TMS. This typically involves providing the necessary credentials, specifying data mapping rules, and setting up data synchronization schedules.

Database Setup: Set up the database for storing and retrieving supply chain data. Create the necessary tables, fields, and relationships to accommodate the imported data. Ensure that the database is properly configured and accessible.

Application Configuration: Configure the application settings, such as database connection details, data retrieval methods, and user authentication settings. Verify that the application is correctly connected to the database and can retrieve the necessary data for analysis.

User Setup: Create user accounts for supply chain professionals and relevant stakeholders who
